services:
    _defaults:
        autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
        autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.
        public: false       # Allows optimizing the container by removing unused services; this also means
                            # fetching services directly from the container via $container->get() won't work.
                            # The best practice is to be explicit about your dependencies anyway.

        resource: '../src/*'
        exclude: '../src/{Migrations}'

    # controllers are imported separately to make sure services can be injected
    # as action arguments even if you don't extend any base controller class
#    App\Controller\:
#        resource: '../src/Controller'
#        tags: ['controller.service_arguments']

    # add more service definitions when explicit configuration is needed
    # please note that last definitions always *replace* previous ones
